    This program is intended to use a monte carlo method to approximated the 
value of the mathematical constant, pi.

Goal: Demonstate that the ratio between the area of the unit circle and the 
square surrounding it, not including the area in the unit circle, converges
to pi.
It uses the fact that the ratio of the area inside a unit circle and a 
square surrounding the unit circle (with length = 2 units) is pi / 4.

Let X ~ Uniform(low = -1, high = 1)
Let Y ~ Uniform(low = -1, high = 1)
Repeatedly generate random numbers from both X & Y, n times.
The ratio between the points (x_i, y_i) that are within the circle
to points outside the circle approximates to the true ratio pi / 4.
Therefore pi can be approximated by 4 * sample-ratio.
