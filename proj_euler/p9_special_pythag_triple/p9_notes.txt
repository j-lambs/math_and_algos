1) Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick

An equation in the form of 1xy + jx + ky = a , where j,k,a are int constants,
==> (x + k)(y + j) - jk = a   ==> (x + k)(y + j) = a + jk

2) Pythagorean Parameterization (Generating Pythag Triples)

a = k (m^2 - n^2), b = k (2mn), c = m^2 + n^2, where m,n are ints, m > n > 0, and m and n are coprime and both not odd.

* Coprime * - means only common factor between 2 ints is 1
